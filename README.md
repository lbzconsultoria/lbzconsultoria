### Hi there 👋 I'm Leonardo, I've been a programmer for a few years, since 2007 to be more exact...
* However, the first projects were from 2012 ...
  * Mostly for infrastructure automation, with shell codes, for files and database backup and integrity checking ...
  * Multiple projects with CMS (Joomla, Drupal, Wordpress, Others) in PHP 
  * Some php projects, I build
  * And many, many hours of debugging and fixing third-party projects 
  * And so many hours doing documentation
  * I used it for testing and updated many projects on ragezone, open source game servers even 2016
  * And in 2018, I had a personal family loss that really made me lose the will to everything, but I kept working even harder than before so I didn't remember or feel, and two years after that I had another loss.
  * I am currently dedicating myself to learning how to create interfaces for end users using the newest technologies, or rather, high-level frameworks, using technologies that have been on the market for a long time (HTML, CSS, ECman Script), but are currently gaining visibility and are going through really amazing updates (The Modern Web)
